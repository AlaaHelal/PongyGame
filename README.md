This repository demonstrates data persistence between scenes and game sessions in Unity (C#), along with UI creation and scene setup.

The core Pong gameplay logic (ball movement, collisions, scoring rules) was provided beforehand.
My work focused on:

Implementing saving and loading logic

Creating and organizing UI scenes and menus

Managing scene flow and persistent state

🎯 Purpose of This Submission

This project fulfills the following requirements:

✅ Create a new GitHub repository

✅ Import an existing Unity project into version control

✅ Implement Scenes Flow

✅ Implement data persistence between scenes and sessions

The primary learning objective of this submission is persistent data management, supported by UI and scene structure.

🧠 My Contribution
✅ Implemented by Me

Data persistence logic

Saving game data during runtime

Loading saved data on scene start

Preserving data across:

Scene transitions

Application restarts

UI creation

Main Scene UI

Menus and interface elements

UI flow between scenes

Scene setup and organization

Version control workflow and commits


🖥 UI & Scene Management

Custom Main Scene UI

Menu and navigation setup

UI connected to saved data (loaded automatically when scenes start)

Scene transitions that preserve data correctly

📝 Notes

This project focuses on data persistence architecture and Scene Flow, not gameplay logic.

Demonstrates practical use of Unity’s persistence tools in a multi-scene project.
